<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

With the rapid growth of the blockchain ecosystem, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has become a prominent platform for fast and secure transactions, asset issuance, and decentralized financial solutions. However, for many users, the technical complexity and learning curve associated with the usability of major projects on the XRPL remain significant barriers to adoption.

To address this challenge, we propose the creation of an innovative AI agent that will serve as a personalized digital tutor, integrated with an advanced LLM-based chatbot. This tutor will be designed to guide users intuitively and efficiently within the XRPL ecosystem, ensuring that even those with little or no technical experience can easily navigate the platform's features.
